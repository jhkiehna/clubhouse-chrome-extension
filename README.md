# github-clubhouse-story-linker-chrome-extension

This is a Chrome extension that allows you to quickly link Github PRs to Clubhouse Stories.

It adds a search input field that hits the Clubhouse API and searches for Clubhouse stories. When a story is selected, it pastes the story link text in a comment field on the PR.
